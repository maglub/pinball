# Windows

I am using Windows 10

## Auto login

* Run -> netplwiz
* A User Accounts window will open. Under Users for this computer: select your username and then uncheck the box next to Users must enter a user name and password to use this computer. Click Apply.
* A new window labeled Automatically sign in will pop up. Type your password twice and then click OK.

Your computer will now bypass the log-in page when you turn on your PC, but it will not bypass the login page when you unlock your PC. You can also change your sign-in options so that Windows will never require you to sign in after your PC wakes from sleep by going to Settings > Accounts > Sign-in options.
